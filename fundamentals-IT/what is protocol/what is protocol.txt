what is protocol ?

  A protocol is a set of rules or standards that define how data is transmitted and received over a network. Protocols ensure that devices can communicate with each other effectively and reliably.

Common Examples of Protocols
Internet & Network Protocols

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) – Used for web page communication.

HTTPS (HTTP Secure) – Secure version of HTTP.

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – For transferring files.

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) – For sending emails.

POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3) – For receiving emails.

IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) – For accessing emails.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) – Reliable, connection-oriented data transmission.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) – Faster, connectionless data transmission.

IP (Internet Protocol) – Routing and addressing packets.

DNS (Domain Name System) – Resolves domain names to IP addresses.

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) – Assigns IP addresses to devices.

SSH (Secure Shell) – Secure remote login.

Telnet – Unsecured remote login.

SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) – Network management.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) – Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses.

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) – Error and status messages (e.g., ping).

Other Protocols

Bluetooth – Wireless communication between devices.

NFC (Near Field Communication) – Short-range wireless communication.

HTTP/2, HTTP/3 – Newer versions of HTTP.

SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) – Secure file transfer.

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) – Directory services.

RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – Remote desktop access.

These are some of the most widely used protocols in networking and communication. There are many more specialized protocols for different purposes.
